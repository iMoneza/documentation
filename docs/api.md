**SPECIAL NOTES**

When executing a PUT request on a resource, it will either create or update the item.  Any subsequent calls with that external ID
will update only the parameters sent.  For example, if the next request contains only the `Title` property, all other properties
will remain the same, only the `Title` will be changed.  The `ExternalKey` cannot be changed with this request.

To change the pricing group that a resource belongs to, the pricing group ID should be sent. All other data sent in 
a `PricingGroup` object will be ignored.  For instance, the following would change the pricing group:

	{
	  "PricingGroup": {
	    "PricingGroupID": "15bf02c5-d106-e411-acf1-bc305bd0d54e"
	  }
	}

Pricing tiers are stored as an array called `ResourcePricingTiers`. If that object is null or not-defined, pricing tiers 
are not updated; if that array is present, then all existing pricing tiers are replaced by the array. So if any pricing 
tiers are set, then all pricing tiers must be set. For example:

    {
	  "ExternalKey": "Article1",
	  "ResourcePricingTiers": [
		{
		  "Tier": 0,
		  "Price": 0.00
		},
		{
		  "Tier": 2,
		  "Price": 0.18
		},
		{
		  "Tier": 5,
		  "Price": 0.50
		},
		{
		  "Tier": 10,
		  "Price": 0.72
		}
	  ]
	}
